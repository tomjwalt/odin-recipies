        <h2> Classic Lasagna</h2>
        <p>This is one recipe my husband begs me to make.
             He is <em>obsessed with this lasagna</em>
             and if he is stressed or overwhelmed
             with work, this is what I make him.
             It is the perfect comfort food meal!
             There's something so amazing
             about homemade,<strong>made-from-scratch lasagna.</strong>
             Whenever he orders beef lasagna at a restaurant,
             he ends up disappointed. This is such a warm,
             <em><strong>comforting dinner</strong></em> and can feed a crowd (or at least a lot of hungry kids).

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
           <li> 1 Tablespoon Olive Olive</li>
           <li>1 small Onion (finely diced)</li>
           <li>1lb lean Ground beef</li>
           <li>3/4 teaspoon Garlic Powder (or 5 garlic cloves, finely minced)</li>
           <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
           <li>1/2 teaspoon Pepper</li>
           <li>32-40 ounce jar Marinara Sauce (may use more depending on how "saucy" you want it)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4> Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li> Preheat an outdoor grill for high and light oily grate</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, combine ground beef, onion, cheese, egg, onion soup mix,
                 minced garlic, garlic powder, soy sauce,
                 Worcestershire sauce, parsley, basil, oregano, rosemary, salt, and pepper
                 in a large bowl. Use your hands to form the mixture into 4 patties.</li>
            <li>Cook patties on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center
                and the juices run clear, about 4 to 5 minutes per side.
                An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read
                at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </li>
        </ol>
