        <h1>Grilled Teriyaki Shrimp</h1>

        <h2>Teriyaki Shrimp</h2>
        <p>These savory-sweet shrimp skewers are easy to make
           and cook in just a few minutes. 
           They are perfect for summer weeknights or weekend dinner parties. 
           Prep the sauce ahead of time for an even faster dinner. 
           I prefer to use jumbo shrimp (21 to 25 per pound), 
           however use what you have on hand.</p>

        <ul>

        </ul>
        <h4> Directions </h4>
        <ol>             
            <li>Combine water, soy sauce, brown sugar, 
                honey, garlic, and ginger in a small saucepan
                and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
                Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer
                until sauce has reduced and thickened
                slightly, 8 to 10 minutes. </li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil grate. 
                Thread shrimp and pineapple alternately
                onto skewers and place on a platter.</li>
            <li>Arrange skewers on the hot grate.
                Grill 2 to 3 minutes per side, 
                or until shrimp is opaque and cooked 
                through. Turn grill to low heat and brush 
                sauce on both sides of skewers. 
                Transfer to a serving platter and sprinkle 
                with cilantro and sesame seeds.</li>
