        <h4> Directions </h4>
        <ol>             
            <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic
                in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.
                Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste,
                and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil,
                1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper.
                Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours,
                stirring occasionally. </li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
                Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes.
                Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl,
                combine ricotta cheese with egg,
                remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom
                of a 9x13-inch baking dish.
                Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce.
                Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture.
                Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices.
                Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella,
                and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers,
                and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
                Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either
                spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil
                does not touch the cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.
                Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.
                Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving. </li>
